<h1>TECH120 Final Project</h1>

<h2>Group 3's Final Project for TECH120 at Purdue University</h2>

<h3>Members: Jenny Lee, Arrow Patel, Luke Latino, and Harjot Singh</h3>

<p>
Our objective is to create a Chrome extension that helps students balance their use of short-form content with studying. Instead of blocking apps completely, our tool tracks time spent on YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and TikTok on desktop, shows a daily “short-form time” meter, and uses gentle pop-up reminders and fun facts to nudge users to take breaks and return to their work. This project is specifically for web applications, not mobile devices. </b>
</p>

An example may be as follows:
<ul>
    <li> When a user opens YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, or TikTok on their computer, the extension starts tracking how long they spend on those short-form feeds. </li> 
    <li> As the user scrolls through YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels, the extension counts their scrolls. After a set number of scrolls, a pop-up appears with a fun fact and shows their total short-form time for the day.</li>
    <li> On TikTok, because the feed is continuous, a pop-up appears every 2 minutes instead of after a specific number of scrolls. </li>
    <li> The extension keeps a running daily total across all three platforms so users can quickly see how much time they’ve spent scrolling short-form content. </li>
</ul>
